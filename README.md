This project contains my customisations for my shell, screen, vim and window
manager bindings.

Requirements
------------

* The zsh setup requires oh-my-zsh to manage installations.
* The xmonad setup requires:
	* xmonad - the super Haskell window manager
	* dzen2 - for the status bars at the top.
  * dmenu, gmrun for launching programs.
	* By default it is configured to launch the lubuntu default apps -
		lxterminal, audacious, leafpad etc.. This can be configured by editing the
    keybinding fie.
